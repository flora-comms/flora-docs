- successfully go the software up and running by following trlink's instructions on the github (https://github.com/trlink/LoRaLink/wiki)
1. configured Arduino environment
2. Cloned libs
3. Formatted FAT32 SD cards
4. Wired up the SD cards to the Heltec V3 devices we had.
5. We were able to join the SoftAPs and see the web page
6. Got an error message. See below:

## Issues

1. "Unable to send message" Alert in web UI when sending messages
- Troubleshooting we did
   - Found function returning the alert: WebMessenger.js in "SendMessageShoutOut" function
     - failed $.ajax call returns error which throws alert
   - Wireshark saw no packets transmitted between client and server, indicating that the error is thrown by the UI not the ESP32 server.
*SOLN:* Opened an issue with trlink's github.

## Total Time: 2.5 hours
