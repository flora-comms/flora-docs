_________________________
PSU - Tella | LVD - Aaron

#### Gantt chart outline
- Outline.xlsx on github, branch created, first issue created
DO IT MONDAY

### IN REVIEW

Issues in review

#### Project Proposal
- submit this afternoon

#### Hardware overview
- Not current, but will be replaced by BOM soon.
cam will just finish it up and be done with it

#### Basic chat UI
done with that for now!

#### Power Audit
- once its in github, just close it

### OTHERS

#### Power supply, YAY!

- Justin's suggestion
  - Good point about the LiFePO4, they have lower nominal voltage and would run in boost mode... noisy.
Covered extensively outside of meeting
252: no noise guarantees or one external inductor, mid efficiency, no need for external inductor
933: two external inductors, high efficiency, okay noise
module: low noise, terrible efficiency,bulky but plug and play, expensive

CHOSEN ONE: 933

## Project Supply Orders

Do we need to order anything?

### Supplier choice
We have decided to use mouser when possible
DigiKey is the backup
