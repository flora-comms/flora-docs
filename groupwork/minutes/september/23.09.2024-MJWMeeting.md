# 23 September 2024 MJW Meeting

# Agenda

## DEMO

- Heltec Hello Rust server
- Schematic

## Power Supplies

- TPS62933P
  - Buck
  - PROS: Spread Spectrum @ selectable frequency, large input voltage range, 2A output (~1A headroom), high efficiency at light loads/low Iq, easily solderable package, has PG pin, cheap (~$1)
  - CONS: Needs external components - EMI filter (optional) and buck L and C along w FB (FB will require careful design to prevent noise from affecting our Vout)

## Schematic v0.0

- Feedback?
- Replacing UART headers with USB
- Questions about PG -> take off of 3.3V Out or off the PSU_EN reference voltage
- Obvious issues with LVD circuit

## Github 

- Req specs and proposal are up
