Main things were:
  - Good start, exceptional style
  - More technical hook discussing the tech we'll we leveraging
  - Intoduce project a bit more, kind of an abstract high level overview before presenting the concrete example in the anecdote
  - Concision in DIY PC example
  - Wrap up our thesis in the project a bit more. A little less explicit. Maybe move stuff from concluding discussion into body.
  - Happy with the structure overall. Use it for the final presentation even!

## Land acknowledgement

Do it as a group

_Aaron_ 

- Territory acknowledgements are an indegenous tradition still followed today when one people visits the territory of another.
- Inspired by territory acknowledgements and recognizing the 94 Calls to Action put forward by the Truth and Reconcilliation committee, Land acknowledgements are a starting place for settlers to understand the deep importance of the land where we work, play, and learn to the Indigenous peoples who have been here since time immemorial, but to also remember the ongoing harm caused by colonialism and the residential school system. Everyone has a role to play in the pursuit of reconciliation that goes far beyond these statements.

- I am a third generation settler from the Netherlands. Fleeing Nazi-occupied Holland, my grandparents settled in the traditional territories of the Erie, Neutral, Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee (ho-den-o-show-nee), and Missisaugas of the Credit under the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant. I now live, work, learn, and play in the unceded traditional territories of the Wsanec and Songhees nations.
