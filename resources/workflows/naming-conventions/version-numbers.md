# Naming with Version Numbers - v(MAJOR).(MINOR).(PATCH)

## MAJOR
The major version number. Updating the major version requires an entire development cycle and it means that requirements have been significantly changed or updated.
### Note about software, "beta" signifier and v0.*.*
Major version number of 0 is reserved for the hardware prototype stage. Most first releases in software and documentation do not need a prototyping stage. Instead, the initial release testing stage should use a major version number of 1 but have a "beta" notation indicating the release is currently being tested/soft-launched and may be unstable (eg. *"AVAlink v1.0 (beta)"*).

## MINOR

The minor version number. A new minor version indicates the addition of new features to a product, but not changes in the requirements. Starts at 0.

## PATCH

The patch version number indicates that an issue has been patched. First patch release starts the patch number at 1 (i.e. initial release of a minor version has a patch number of 0).
If a patch number is absent, assume 0.
