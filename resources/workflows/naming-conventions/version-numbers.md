# Naming with Version Numbers

## v(MAJOR).(MINOR).(PATCH)

*MAJOR*: The major version number. Updating the major version requires an entire development cycle and it means that requirements have been significantly changed or updated.
The protoyping stage will use a Major version number of 0
*MINOR*: The minor version number. A new minor version indicates the addition of new features to a product, but not changes in the requirements. Starts at 0.
*PATCH*: The patch version number indicates that an issue has been patched. First patch release starts the patch number at 1 (i.e. initial release of a minor version has a patch number of 0).
If a patch number is absent, assume 0.
