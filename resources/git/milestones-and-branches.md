# Milestones and Branches

Each milestone will have a branch created from the main branch to manage its progress.
Issues related to the milestone's progress will be created in the appropriate repo from the CDM project and linked to the milestone.
If an issue requires its own branch, the branch is created from the related milestone branch, not the main branch.
