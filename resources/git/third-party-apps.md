# Using Third Party Apps without Git Support

## MS Word, Excel
Pull the latest VERSION (not commit) from Github. Coordinate with others to make sure it is safe to edit: no one else has a current working version.
Open the file, work on it, close it. Save it to the Google drive.
Only commit new versions to github, not half-finished working copies.

## Altium
Use the built-in Altium version control
Only submit finished versions to github.
